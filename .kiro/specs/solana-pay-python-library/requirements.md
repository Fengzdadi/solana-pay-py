# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive Python implementation of the Solana Pay protocol. The library will provide Python developers with the tools to integrate Solana Pay functionality into their applications, supporting both client-side URL generation/parsing and server-side transaction request handling. The implementation will be compatible with the official Solana Pay specification and interoperable with existing Solana Pay wallets and applications.

The implementation will follow a milestone-driven approach focusing on core functionality first, then expanding to advanced features. Key priorities include strict SPEC compliance, robust decimal handling, versioned transactions (v0), and comprehensive validation to ensure interoperability with the JavaScript ecosystem.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: URL Encoding and Parsing (Milestone M1)

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want to generate and parse Solana Pay URLs, so that I can create payment requests and handle incoming payment URLs in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a TransferRequest is provided with valid parameters THEN the system SHALL generate a properly formatted solana: URL
2. WHEN a solana: URL is parsed THEN the system SHALL return a TransferRequest object with all parameters correctly extracted
3. WHEN an https: URL is parsed THEN the system SHALL return a TransferRequest object suitable for transaction request discovery
4. IF amount is provided THEN the system SHALL validate it as a non-negative Decimal value with proper decimal formatting
5. WHEN multiple references are provided THEN the system SHALL preserve their order in both encoding and parsing
6. WHEN field naming is used THEN the system SHALL align with official SPEC naming conventions (splToken, not spl_token in URLs)
7. IF invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL raise appropriate ValueError exceptions with descriptive messages
8. WHEN URL encoding special characters THEN the system SHALL follow standard URL encoding rules for interoperability

### Requirement 2: Transaction Building (Milestone M2)

**User Story:** As a Python backend developer, I want to build Solana transactions for payment processing, so that I can create valid transactions that wallets can sign and submit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transfer request is received THEN the system SHALL build a valid versioned transaction (v0 format)
2. IF the transfer is for SOL THEN the system SHALL create a system transfer instruction
3. IF the transfer is for an SPL token THEN the system SHALL create appropriate token transfer instructions with proper decimal handling
4. WHEN an Associated Token Account doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL include instructions to create it automatically
5. IF a memo is provided THEN the system SHALL include a memo instruction in the transaction
6. WHEN references are provided THEN the system SHALL include them as additional signers following SPEC requirements
7. WHEN building transactions THEN the system SHALL use Decimal types to avoid floating-point errors in amount calculations
8. IF priority fees are needed THEN the system SHALL support configurable priority fee strategies
9. IF the transaction building fails THEN the system SHALL raise appropriate exceptions with error details

### Requirement 3: Transaction Request Server (Milestone M3)

**User Story:** As a merchant, I want to run a transaction request server, so that wallets can discover and request payment transactions from my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /tx THEN the system SHALL return transaction metadata including label and optional icon
2. WHEN a POST request is made to /tx with valid account data THEN the system SHALL return a base64-serialized unsigned transaction
3. IF the POST request contains invalid data THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error responses
4. WHEN building transactions THEN the system SHALL use the provided payer account as the transaction fee payer
5. IF RPC communication fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error responses
6. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL be configurable for different Solana clusters (devnet, testnet, mainnet)
7. WHEN serving requests THEN the system SHALL be compatible with major wallets (Phantom, Solflare) following SPEC guidelines
8. IF async operations are used THEN the system SHALL use AsyncClient for better throughput and stability

### Requirement 4: Transaction Validation and Confirmation (Milestone M4)

**User Story:** As a merchant, I want to validate and confirm payment transactions, so that I can verify that payments have been successfully processed on the Solana blockchain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction signature is provided THEN the system SHALL verify the transaction exists on the blockchain using wait_and_verify functionality
2. WHEN validating a transaction THEN the system SHALL strictly validate recipient, amount, mint, references, and memo fields
3. IF a transaction contains the expected recipient and amount THEN the system SHALL mark it as valid
4. WHEN checking transaction status THEN the system SHALL return confirmation level (processed, confirmed, finalized)
5. IF reference validation is required THEN the system SHALL verify reference accounts are correctly included and ordered
6. WHEN parsing transactions THEN the system SHALL examine instruction data and account balances for comprehensive validation
7. IF timeouts or retries are needed THEN the system SHALL support configurable timeout and retry policies
8. WHEN a transaction fails validation THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information with specific field mismatches

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer using the library, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues and handle edge cases gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation fails THEN the system SHALL raise specific exception types with descriptive messages
2. WHEN RPC operations fail THEN the system SHALL distinguish between network errors and blockchain errors
3. IF invalid input is provided THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and raise ValueError with specific field information
4. WHEN logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log important operations and errors at appropriate levels
5. IF debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed transaction and RPC call information
6. WHEN exceptions occur THEN the system SHALL preserve the original error context in exception chains

### Requirement 6: Configuration and Flexibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable options for different environments and use cases, so that I can adapt the library to my specific requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the library THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of RPC endpoints for different clusters
2. IF custom fee payer logic is needed THEN the system SHALL support pluggable fee calculation strategies
3. WHEN working with different SPL tokens THEN the system SHALL support token-specific configurations
4. IF rate limiting is required THEN the system SHALL support configurable RPC request throttling
5. WHEN using in production THEN the system SHALL support connection pooling and retry mechanisms
6. IF custom validation rules are needed THEN the system SHALL allow extension of validation logic

### Requirement 7: Testing and Documentation (Milestone M5)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests and documentation, so that I can confidently use and contribute to the library.
